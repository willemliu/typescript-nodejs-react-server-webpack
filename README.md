# typescript-nodejs-react-server-redux-webpack
This is a example project showcasing server side React rendering. The use-case is to create a React website which is SEO-friendly and has a very fast first load.
React Components are interchangeable between server and client applications and in order to have it work correctly, server-side state must be transfered to the client so the React Components start out with the correct states. To achieve this we make use of Redux.
