# typescript-nodejs-react-server-redux-webpack
This is a example project showcasing a multi-page server side React rendering. The use-case is to create a React website which is SEO-friendly and has a very fast first load.
React Components are interchangeable between server and client applications and in order to have it work correctly, server-side state must be transfered to the client so the React Components start out with the correct states. To achieve this we make use of Redux.

Most React-Redux examples one can find on the web are mostly very simple example applications like ToDo lists which don't reflect how a more complex website could be implemented. So in this example project I showcase a more complex React-Redux application with multiple components, compositions and component iterations while altogether having a normalized Redux store to support it.
